# Admin System Updates Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. OTP-Based Admin Login System
We've replaced the email/password login system with a more secure OTP-based verification flow with two options:

- **Email OTP Verification**:
  - **Email Utility**: Created `email-utils.ts` to send OTP codes via email using nodemailer
  - **API Routes**:
    - Added `/api/auth/admin-otp/generate` to send OTP to admin email
    - Added `/api/auth/admin-otp/verify` to verify email OTP and authenticate admin

- **SMS OTP Verification with Twilio Verify** (NEW):
  - **SMS Utility**: Created `sms-utils.ts` to initiate and check verification codes using Twilio Verify service
  - **API Routes**:
    - Added `/api/auth/admin-otp/generate-sms` to initiate verification to admin phone
    - Added `/api/auth/admin-otp/verify-sms` to check verification code and authenticate admin

- **Admin OTP Model**: Used for email verification, while SMS verification leverages Twilio Verify service
- **Login UI**: Enhanced the admin login page to support:
  - Choice between email or SMS verification methods
  - Email entry followed by OTP verification
  - Phone entry followed by SMS verification
  - Bypass mode for offline/development use
  - Clear user feedback during the login process

### 2. Real Data Integration
Fixed the issue where admin dashboard showed demo data instead of actual MongoDB data:

- **Dashboard API**: Created `/api/admin/dashboard` endpoint to fetch real data:
  - Total users count
  - Total products count
  - Total orders count
  - Recent orders list
- **Dashboard UI**: Updated to display real data from MongoDB
  - Added refresh functionality
  - Improved error handling
  - Dynamic table population

### 3. Environment Configuration
Added support for environment variables:

- Updated README-ENV-SETUP.md with instructions for setting up:
  - MongoDB connection
  - JWT secret
  - Email configuration for OTP
  - Admin email specification
  - Twilio Verify configuration for SMS verification (NEW)
  - Admin phone number for SMS verification

## How to Use the New Admin System

1. **Setup**:
   - Create `.env.local` file following the instructions in README-ENV-SETUP.md
   - Ensure you have an admin user in MongoDB with role set to "admin"
   - Set the ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PHONE environment variables to match your admin credentials

2. **Admin Login Process**:
   - Navigate to /admin/login
   - Choose your preferred verification method (Email or SMS)
   
   - **For Email OTP**:
     - Enter the admin email (defaults to avitoluxury@gmail.com)
     - System sends OTP to that email
     - Enter the OTP code received
   
   - **For SMS Verification**:
     - Enter the admin phone number (defaults to 8126518755)
     - System initiates a verification using Twilio Verify service
     - Receive the verification code via SMS
     - Enter the verification code received
   
   - After verification, you'll be redirected to the admin dashboard

3. **Offline/Development Mode**:
   - If email/SMS sending fails or you're developing offline
   - Click "Use Direct Access" button
   - Use the bypass credentials (email or phone with OTP: 123456)

## Security Improvements

- Multiple verification methods (email and SMS)
- Industry-standard Twilio Verify service for SMS verification
- Removed hardcoded admin credentials
- Email OTP expires after 10 minutes
- Rate limiting for verification requests
- Prevention of enumeration attacks
- Token-based API authorization
- Environment variable based configuration

## Fallback Mechanisms

- Bypass mode for when email/SMS services are unavailable
- Database connection error handling
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Automatic admin phone number registration if missing in the database
